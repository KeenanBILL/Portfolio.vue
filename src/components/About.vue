                    <p>I am always striving to learn new skills & over the past three years studying, working part-time has taught me valuable skills, that I am able to incorporate in my career. I am a God fearing individual that is hungry for happiness from others. Making others happy is what drives me to be ambitious & devoted to be an advocate of change regardless if I make a minor impact. When storms and trails come, I will try my best to be there to lift your head up. Doing this I hope people also acquire the value of resilience in their life.
